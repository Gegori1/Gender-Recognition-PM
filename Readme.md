### GENDER-RECOGNITION-MODELS


This module contains code for creating models to recognize gender given an image.

The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can predict the gender of a person based on an input image. This module includes functions and classes for training and evaluating these models.

Usage:
- Import this module to access the functions and classes.
- Use the provided functions to train and evaluate gender recognition models.
- Refer to the README file in each module for more details.

The following modules are included:

`NN`: Contains the models based on CNN and RNN.

`SVM`: Contains the models based on SVM using kernels based on the Wasserstein metric.

`label_data`: Contains functions for labeling and augmenting the data.
